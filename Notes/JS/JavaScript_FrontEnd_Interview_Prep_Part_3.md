## 7. Redux (Part 2)

### Redux Middleware
Middleware in Redux is used to enhance the store by allowing the dispatching of functions, handling side effects, logging, and much more. Common middleware includes **redux-thunk** and **redux-saga**.

- **redux-thunk**: Enables action creators to return functions instead of actions, allowing for async logic such as data fetching.
- **redux-saga**: Uses generator functions to handle complex async operations, making it easier to manage side effects in a scalable way.

```javascript
// Thunk Example
const fetchData = () => {
  return async (dispatch) => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_DATA_SUCCESS', payload: data });
  };
};

// Saga Example
function* fetchDataSaga() {
  try {
    const response = yield call(fetch, '/api/data');
    const data = yield response.json();
    yield put({ type: 'FETCH_DATA_SUCCESS', payload: data });
  } catch (error) {
    yield put({ type: 'FETCH_DATA_FAILURE', error });
  }
}
```

### Selector Functions
Selectors are functions used to select data from the store. They help encapsulate the logic of accessing specific slices of the state, improving code maintainability.

```javascript
const getCompletedTasks = (state) => state.tasks.filter(task => task.completed);
```

### Redux Toolkit
Redux Toolkit is an official, recommended way to write Redux logic, focusing on reducing boilerplate and simplifying common tasks.

```javascript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: state => { state.value += 1 },
    decrement: state => { state.value -= 1 },
  }
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

## 8. JSX

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. Itâ€™s transpiled by Babel into regular JavaScript calls to `React.createElement`.

### Basic JSX Syntax:
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

JSX expressions are embedded inside `{}` within the return statement of React components. You can also use JavaScript expressions directly inside JSX.

### Example:
```jsx
function Greeting(props) {
  const name = props.name || 'Guest';
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

### JSX and Babel:
Behind the scenes, Babel transpiles JSX into JavaScript:
```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
// Is transpiled into:
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');
```

### JSX in Practice:
- JSX makes React code more readable.
- You can use loops, conditionals, and other JavaScript logic inside JSX.
- Components return JSX that represents the UI structure.
